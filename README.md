# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Machine Learning. The dataset is highly imbalanced, requiring advanced preprocessing techniques like **Undersampling** to build an accurate Logistic Regression model.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Data Analysis:** Explored transaction patterns and statistical summaries.
* **Imbalance Handling:** Used Undersampling to balance Legit vs. Fraud cases.
* **Model:** Built a Logistic Regression model with **High Accuracy**.
* **Prediction System:** Created a function to classify new transactions in real-time.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* Python
* Pandas & NumPy (Data Manipulation)
* Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)
* Google Colab

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
